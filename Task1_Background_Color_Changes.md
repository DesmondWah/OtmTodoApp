# Task 1: Teamwork and CI/CD Integration - Background Color Enhancement

## 1. Workflow Architecture and Planning

### 1.1 Repository Management Strategy

Our team adopted a **fork-and-collaborate** approach for this project:

- **Source Repository**: Forked from the original OtmTodoApp repository
- **Team Repository**: VivaciousEmu/OtmTodoApp
- **Branching Strategy**: Feature branches for individual contributions
- **Integration Method**: Pull requests with automated CI validation

### 1.2 CI/CD Pipeline Architecture

The Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipeline serves as the backbone of our collaborative workflow:

```
Developer Workflow:
1. Clone team repository
2. Create feature branch (e.g., feature/background-colors)
3. Make changes (UI/UX modifications)
4. Commit and push changes
5. Create pull request to main branch
6. CI pipeline automatically validates changes
7. Merge after successful validation
```

### 1.3 CI Pipeline Components

**GitHub Actions Workflows:**
- **Maven Build Workflow**: Original workflow for basic build validation
- **Enhanced CI Workflow**: Comprehensive pipeline with testing and artifact generation

**Pipeline Steps:**
1. **Code Checkout**: Retrieve latest code from repository
2. **Environment Setup**: Configure JDK 17 and Maven dependencies
3. **Dependency Caching**: Optimize build performance
4. **Build Process**: Compile application (`mvn clean compile`)
5. **Testing**: Execute unit tests (`mvn test`)
6. **Packaging**: Create deployable artifacts (`mvn package`)
7. **Artifact Upload**: Generate test reports and build outputs

### 1.4 Team Collaboration Benefits

The CI pipeline ensures:
- **Quality Assurance**: Every change is automatically tested
- **Conflict Prevention**: Build failures are caught before integration
- **Continuous Integration**: Multiple team contributions are seamlessly merged
- **Automated Validation**: UI changes don't break core functionality

## 2. Demonstration of Team-Based Development

### 2.1 Repository Structure

```

├── .github/workflows/          # CI/CD configuration
│   ├── maven-build.yml        # Original build workflow
│   └── ci.yml                 # Enhanced CI workflow
├── src/
│   ├── main/java/todoapp/     # Application source code

└── pom.xml                    # Maven build configuration
```

### 2.2 Collaborative Development Process

**Team Coordination:**
- Each team member worked on specific UI/UX improvements
- Changes were made to enhance user experience through background color modifications
- Focused approach on visual improvements without breaking functionality

**CI Integration:**
- Every UI change triggered automatic build and test validation
- Successful builds indicated changes didn't break existing functionality
- Failed builds provided immediate feedback for necessary corrections

## 3. Before and After Evidence

### 3.1 Original Application Interface (Before)
*[Before screenshots will be inserted here]*

**Original Background Colors:**
- Login Screen: Default white background
- User Creation Screen: Default white background
- Main Interface: Default white background

### 3.2 Enhanced Application Interface (After)
*[After screenshots will be inserted here]*

**Enhanced Background Colors:**
- Login Screen: Light Blue background (`Color.LIGHTBLUE`)
- User Creation Screen: Light Green background (`Color.LIGHTGREEN`)
- Main Interface: Light Cyan background (`Color.LIGHTCYAN`)

### 3.3 Technical Implementation

**Background Color Changes Made:**
```java
// Login Scene
loginScene.setFill(Color.LIGHTBLUE);

// User Creation Scene  
newUserScene.setFill(Color.LIGHTGREEN);

// Main Todo Scene
todoScene.setFill(Color.LIGHTCYAN);
```
